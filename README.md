# evaluatePrefixAlgo
## a non-generic implementation for evaluating expressions in Polish notation

**USAGE:** after compiling and creating a binary please pass in arguments at the command-line as follows:

```bash
./a.out <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>
```

where arguments are assumed to be operators followed by operands in polish notation. Operands can only be
integers as the implementation is non-generic for simplicity's sake.
